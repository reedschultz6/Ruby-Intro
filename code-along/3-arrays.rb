# p mixed_array
# p mixed_array.length

# Accessing the array

# puts mixed_array[2]
# puts mixed_array[-2]

# shopping_lists = [["milk", "eggs", "toilet paper",], ["soap", "shampoo", "shaving cream"]]
# p shopping_lists

# p shopping_lists[1][2]

# Add to the array

# favorite_foods << "more tacos"
# puts favorite_foods

favorite_foods.push "more tacos"
# puts favorite_foods
# p favorite_foods

favorite_foods= favorite_foods + ["french fries", "ramen"]
